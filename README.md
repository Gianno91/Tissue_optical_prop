# Tissue-optical-prop

Calculation of optical properties of biological tissues for Monte Carlo simulations.

It contains a MATLAB function for the calculation of the absorption and scattering coefficients, plus a text file with the molar extinction coefficients of HbO2 and HHb according to different wavelengths. 

All the equations for the estimate of the optical properties and different values of the inputs to the MATLAB function are taken from the following paper (also included):
